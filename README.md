# Java Singleton Project

## Description
This project demonstrates the **Singleton design pattern** in Java alongside basic list management functionality. The program creates a single instance of a class that interacts with a list of products, adding and sequentially displaying them with a delay. It also includes a simple `CounterClass` for managing string values, though it is not actively used in the current implementation.
